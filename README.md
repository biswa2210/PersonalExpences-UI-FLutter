## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
This is a Flutter Application for keeping personal expenses' record. The application is for both android and ios. The name of this app is Galaxy UI. This app is for watching records in charts not for keeping database. Here we can add expenses by adding title, amount, date. Here we can choose date from e virtual calendar. We can compare multiple records in a week in a form of a chart. We can use it for analysing and calculating one week's expenses. Watching the records in form of chart helps us understanding how much expences we had throughout the week. We can also delete records as per our need. We can balance our weekly cost with it.
